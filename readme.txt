Dear friends,

Coming up with a new solution for every problem takes time, and often it’s really not necessary. We can rely on smart design patterns and ask the right questions ahead of time to avoid issues down the line. This deck of 100 cards is supposed to help with just that.

Just before starting a project, I would sit down with designers and developers and talk through the questions listed in this deck. It helps save time and drive to better decisions when tackling pretty much any interface challenge — from intricate data tables and web forms to troublesome hamburgers and carousels.

Each checklist has been curated and refined over 8 years by yours truly — all based upon usability sessions, design iterations and A/B tests. So my sincere hope is that this deck will be helpful for your work to bring up important conversations before issues arise, not forget anything crucial that would cause trouble in usability tests, and be prepared for whatever comes next.

In this .ZIP file, you'll find a few files:

* Cards Deck PDF contains the deck of cards, beautifully illustrated by our dear illustrator Ricardo Gimenes (https://twitter.com/behindcadi)

* Slides PDF contains 400 slides with practical examples, action points and the checklists in the wide (16x9) format for your presentations.

* Editable Text File contains a Markdown version of the checklist just in case you need to quickly customize it for your needs

* Visuals contains some images that you can use to share the good news about your kind purchase with your friends and colleagues.

* You will always find an up-to-date deck of cards at https://www.smashed.by/ui-deck, so please keep the URL close. :)

If you have any questions, please drop an email over to me at vitaly@smashingmagazine.com and I'd love to help as far as I can! :-)

Please don't share the entire deck publicly if possible — and thank you so much for your kind support! Meow, and thanks for being smashing, now and ever.
